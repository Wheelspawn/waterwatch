Project Workflow:

To add a feature, follow these steps.

1. Do a `git pull` to receive the latest changes from `master`.
2. Create your branch with `git checkout -b feature_branch`. The name of the branch must be about the feature.
3. Add and commit your features to your feature branch.
4. Do `git checkout master` to switch to `master` and do another `git pull` to receive latest changes from `master`.
5. Do`git merge --no-ff feature_branch` to merge your changes.
6. Do `git push` to push to master.
7. Do `git branch -d feature_branch` to delete your feature branch.
